# Numerical-Value-Predictor
# Linear Regression Example

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Linear Regression model using Python to predict a numerical value based on a single feature. The model is built using a small dataset and visualizes the regression line against the data points.

## Overview

In this project, we create a linear regression model that predicts a target variable based on a single feature. The dataset consists of two columns: one representing the feature and the other representing the target variable. We train the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
